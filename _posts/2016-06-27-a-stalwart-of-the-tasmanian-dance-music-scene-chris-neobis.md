  A stalwart of the Tasmanian dance music scene, Chris neoBi's first foray into
  the world of DJing was through community radio in 1994. With a passionate love
  for the music, and driven to expose this music to a wider audience, Chris then
  launched into a career in the clubs which has seen him play alongside many of
  Australia's finest DJs, not to mention a number of the world's best.
  International luminaries Chris has supported include Crazy Penis, Dave Clarke,
  Lottie, Dave Seaman, Infusion, BT, Ian Pooley, Lucien Foort, Evil Nine,
  Kaskade, James Holden, Steve Gerrard, Monkey Safari, Lancelot, John Kelly and
  Ashley Casselle, to name but a few. When a promoter requires a controlled
  warm-up set to set the night off right, or a follow-up set to remember, it is
  most often that they call on Chris to play.
